# Geomino
Geomino is a casual turn-based puzzle game inspired by domino.
The goal of the game is to score the highest number of points.

# Description
Players are each given 4 triangular chips, with the sides numbered with digits from 0 to 6, and each side of a single chip has a unique number. First, an empty chip (with all sides numbered 0) is placed on the playing field, after which players take turns making moves.

## Moves
* The player's task is to choose one of their 4 chips and place it next to the chips already laid out on the field so that it touches them with at least one side, and the touching sides must have the same number.
* If the chip is docked to one side, the player receives as many points as there were on the docking side. If the chip is docked to two sides at once, the player receives a total number of points for two sides. And similarly for the three sides.
* Not all chips can be placed during a player's turn. Such chips are marked in grey and are inactive for the game. If all chips are inactive during a player's turn, the player skips their turn.
* If a player has no chips left to play, they also skip their turn.
* The game ends when all players have skipped their turn.

## Maps
For a more varied and interesting game, players are offered a choice of several maps:
* Endless.
* Hallway.
* Hexagon.
* Columns.

Places occupied by leaves are not available for placing a chip.

# Singleplayer
The game offers the option to compete against computer bots if your friends are busy. For each bot, you can set a different difficulty level:
* Easy.
* Medium.
* Hard.
* Impossible.

The easier the difficulty level, the more often the bot makes mistakes. However, with a random arrangement of random chips on the field, you won't be able to beat even the easiest bot.

# Multiplayer
To start playing with your friends, you need to go to the corresponding menu and create a room. Your friends must go to the same menu and refresh the list of available rooms. After that, they should find your room in the list and click on it. Once everyone is in the room, you can start the game.
